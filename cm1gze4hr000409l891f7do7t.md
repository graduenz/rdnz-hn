## Context

Another thing that I recently found out about while working on a project mentioned in [this other post](https://hashnode.com/post/cm1c3wpf7000g09mgcsgrh9e1) is the `required` modifier.

I needed to set up a simple model for Advertiser in my code with the following properties:

| Property | Required |
| --- | --- |
| Name | **Yes** |
| Description | No |
| Email | No |
| Phone | No |
| Contact Instructions | No |

## First option

So that’s how I wrote the code for this model’s DTO class the first time:

```csharp
public class AdvertiserDto : BaseDto
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public string? Email { get; set; }
    public string? Phone { get; set; }
    public string? ContactInstructions { get; set; }
}
```

It must either be constructorless or have a parameterless constructor because that is the class that is coming in and going out in the controller’s actions / APIs, so the serializer can create an instance and set the properties’ values.

As a modern C# project, it has [nullable types enabled by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types) at the project level. That means, if I add a non-nullable `string` property, it must be initialized after leaving the constructor, or the IDE will complain with a warning: *Non-nullable property 'Name' is uninitialized. Consider declaring the property as nullable.*

And for that reason, I could not make the `string? Name` be just `string Name`.

That will definitely work, but will be wrong in the OpenAPI specification that is generated in the API project, showing that the property is optional, but we know it’s not:

## The `required` modifier

Then, I was looking for a better solution for this, with some considerations:

* I didn’t want to have this property marked as optional.
    
* Can’t add parameters to the constructor and set it as non-nullable.
    
* The `[Required]` attribute on a nullable property doesn’t make sense. It would leave the type in the screenshot above as something like:
    
    * *“name: string | nullable \[Required\]“.*
        
* I also didn’t want to suppress any warnings.
    

So I changed it to a non-nullable `string` property and checked what would be the options given by the IDE and/or ReSharper, and that one caught my attention:

I gave it a chance and the code ended up like this:

```csharp
public class AdvertiserDto : BaseDto
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
// ...
```

That way, I ended up with the best possible solution:

* Not using an optional type for nullable.
    
* Not needing to add a constructor to initialize the property.
    
* Serializer is able to serialize and deserialize the class without any issue.
    
* OpenAPI specification gets correctly generated (screenshot below).

Though, every time I instantiate that class by myself, I need to set something to the Name property, like the example below, or it won’t compile.

```csharp
var advertiser = new AdvertiserDto {
    Name = "Bdvertiser"
};
```

But anyway, that’s not a problem at all, at least for now.

## Conclusion

That’s how I found out about the `required` modifier, which was introduced in C# at the end of 2022 with C# 11 (and .NET 7). [Check the official docs here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/required).

What I mean with “modern C# problems” in the title is that in older C# projects, specially when using .NET Framework, you don’t even have the optional `string?` type, and the `string` type is nullable by default. In those situations, something like the `[Required]` attribute can help.
